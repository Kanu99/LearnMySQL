# LearnMySQL
The goal for this project is to master SQL from scratch.  The plan is to go through resources online and try to use the knowledge I've gained towards a final project.

Day 1
  Today I used videos on YT to learn how to set up MySQL and retrieve data from a single table.
  I am also using Programming with Mosh's database to try experiment with different commands

Day 2
  Today I self-taught how to handle data when there are multiple tables.
